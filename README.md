# Project 1
I developed "Awaiz Clothing," a landing page for a fictional clothing store, to enhance my web development skills. This project involved creating a responsive and visually appealing website using HTML and CSS. I focused on structuring the page with clear section divisions, utilizing padding and margins for optimal spacing, and arranging items effectively to ensure a user-friendly experience. The site features a navigation bar, product listings with images and prices, promotional banners, and informational sections about services like free shipping and fast delivery. Additionally, I incorporated a newsletter subscription form to engage users further. I'm excited to share this project on GitHub as a testament to my progress and to contribute to the web development community.
